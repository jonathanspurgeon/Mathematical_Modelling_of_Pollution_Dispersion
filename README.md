We aim to understand how concentration of pollutants from large industrial chimneys vary with distance and time, as well as the influence of factors such
as wind speed and direction. To achieve this, we model the dispersion of pollutants using a 
two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation based on Gaussian plume model with some limitation, 
employing both analytical techniques and the backward Euler numerical method, all under
reasonable assumptions. The analysis successfully produced plots showing pollutant concentration
as a function of both time and distance from the chimney. Based on these results, we can develop
an optimal strategy for pollutant release that adapts to daily wind variations and suggests pollutant
release during periods of higher wind speeds to promote wider dispersion and reduce peak concentration.
